RISK ASSESSMENT AND RESPONSE GUIDELINES

1. RISK SCORING METHODOLOGY
- Multi-factor risk scoring combining: amount, velocity, geography, behavior, quantum analysis
- Final risk score formula: Classical Features (60%) + Quantum Classifier Output (40%)
- Risk levels: LOW (0-30), MEDIUM (31-60), HIGH (61-85), CRITICAL (86-100)
- Adaptive thresholds: Baselines adjusted per user historical behavior

2. ALERT CLASSIFICATION LEVELS
- Level 1 (Informational): Unusual but likely legitimate activity - monitor passively
- Level 2 (Warning): Suspicious pattern detected - analyst review within 1 hour
- Level 3 (Alert): High probability of fraud - immediate review required within 15 minutes
- Level 4 (Critical): Confirmed fraud indicators - block transaction and notify customer

3. RESPONSE PROCEDURES
- Level 1: Log event and continue monitoring. No customer notification required.
- Level 2: Flag account for enhanced monitoring. Analyst review within 60 minutes.
- Level 3: Temporary transaction hold. Customer verification call initiated. Analyst review within 15 minutes.
- Level 4: Immediate transaction block. Freeze account. Law enforcement notification if applicable.

4. FALSE POSITIVE MANAGEMENT
- Acceptable false positive rate: Below 5% for Level 3 and above alerts
- Customer friction budget: Maximum 2 verification requests per week per customer
- Machine learning model retraining trigger: False positive rate exceeding 8%
- Quantum classifier recalibration: Monthly or after 1000 cumulative false positives
- Customer feedback loop: Verified false positives fed back into training data

5. ESCALATION MATRIX
- Analyst to Senior Analyst: Unresolved Level 3 alerts after 15 minutes
- Senior Analyst to Fraud Manager: Multiple related Level 3+ alerts from same pattern
- Fraud Manager to Compliance Officer: Regulatory reporting triggers detected
- Compliance Officer to Law Enforcement: Confirmed fraud exceeding $50,000
- Automatic escalation: Any single transaction exceeding $100,000

6. REPORTING AND AUDIT
- Daily summary reports of all alerts generated and resolved
- Weekly trend analysis of fraud patterns and detection accuracy
- Monthly compliance reports for regulatory bodies
- Quarterly model performance review and recalibration
- Annual third-party audit of fraud detection systems
